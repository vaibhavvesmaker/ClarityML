# 🚀 ClarityML: Scalable, No-Code AutoML & Explainable AI Platform

--- 

## 📌 Overview

**ClarityML** is a powerful, scalable, no-code platform designed to streamline and democratize Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Explainable AI (XAI). Built for data analysts, machine learning engineers, and non-technical stakeholders alike, ClarityML accelerates model development, simplifies interpretability, and promotes collaborative data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Why ClarityML?

With the rise of complex datasets, predictive accuracy alone isn't sufficient. **Interpretability** and **ease-of-use** have become essential. ClarityML tackles these challenges by offering:

- **Automated Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Rich Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tools**
- **Comprehensive AutoML Capabilities** (Regression, Classification, Time Series)
- **Deep Explainability & Fairness Analysis**
- **Easy Model Deployment & Monitoring**

---

## 🌟 Core Features

✅ **Data Handling & Cleaning:**
- Automated preprocessing (missing value imputation, outlier handling, encoding)
- Real-time data ingestion from databases, APIs, and cloud storage
- Versioned data and schema validation

✅ **Advanced AutoML Capabilities:**
- Rapid model training with regression, classification, and forecasting algorithms
- Built-in support for Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TensorFlow
- Customizable hyperparameter optimization (Optuna)

✅ **Model Explainability & Fairness:**
- Integrated SHAP, LIME, EBM for deep interpretability
- Bias detection and fairness auditing
- Interactive dashboards for global/local explanations

✅ **Deployment & Scalability:**
- One-click deployment to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-prem
- Continuous monitoring of models (drift, accuracy, fairness)
- Scheduled automated model retraining

✅ **Collaboration & Governance:**
- Multi-user, role-based access
- Built-in version control and audit trails
- Real-time collaborative annotations and commenting
